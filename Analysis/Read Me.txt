Coding Scheme:
Gaze:
+ Around = 1
+ Monitor = 2
+ Keyboard = 3
+ Face = 4
Talking:
+ No speaking = 1
+ Typing = 2
+ Speaking = 3
+ SSS = 4
+ Hovering = 5


The overall data:
+ OverallData_EndTime_5min.csv : This is what you want, I make sure all of them end at 5 minutes with is 9000 frame.
+ OverallData_EndTime_Actual.csv: This is a little extra, I use the actual time that the conversation was stop, which is a litte more than 5 minutes


The specific data for each conversation:
+ I includes this in here because sometimes the gaze and talking codes do not align with each other
+ It is in the “Data/Gaze/CSV” and “Data/Talking/CSV”, there are two folder in them “Simple” and “Expand”
+ In the “Simple” folder, the supposed header of its column is “Start Time ”, “End Time”, “Coding number”. This is just a direct translation from the XML file (the exported file from Adobe)
+ In the “Expand” folder, the I expanded the value of the simple into frame to frame code. 


Final Note:
+ The “Data/Gaze/XML” and “Data/Talking/XML” is the raw data from the Adobe
