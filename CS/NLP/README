THIS IS A MODIFICATION of the CRF++ program by Taku Kudo <taku@chasen.org>

As I change the install file, I might have to reinstall the crf++ again everytime I am in a new machine

Note:
after install the crf and the python wrapper

run:
sudo ldconfig

next, check the model in the test.py to make sure you are using the right model


We need to use a POS in addition for the CRF++ as the input required the word and the POS in order to output 
Hence, we use textblob-aptagger for it (might try NLTK):

pip install -U textblob-aptagger
