Best of all = 105

Note: 
Best of all means I choose the tag that most of the coders agree on. In case of equal numbers of vote between two tags, I chose the one that Amanda and Morgan pick because they code the most and I feel like it will be better than randomly pick a side. The reason is that we are coding frame by frame, radomization might cause the tags change rapidly between two categories. 
Hence, the data might be a little bias toward Amanda and Morgan
